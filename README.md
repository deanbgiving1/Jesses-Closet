Jesse’s Closet is a simple web project built using Python’s Flask as well as some basic HTML. The goal of this website was for it to be a curated collection for clothing items inspired by Jesse Pinkman, an iconic character from the TV show Breaking Bad.

Jesse’s fashion sense is characterized by oversized hoodies, bold graphic tees, and baggy jeans, a style that has been a staple in pop-culture since the shows release over 15 years ago. Whether you're looking for exact replicas of outfits he wore in the show or similar pieces that fit the aesthetic, this site is designed to be a resource for fans of his look. It showcases how Flask can be used to build a straightforward yet functional site that doesn't require a public domain to be accessed.

To run the program, go to your command prompt and find the directory the "jesses_closet" folder is in and run "python app.py".

For example
C:\Users\yourname\Desktop\jesses_closet>python app.py

If you get an error about flask, do "pip install flask" first.
To change directories use "cd Desktop/jesses_closet"
